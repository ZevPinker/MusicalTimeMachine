      The data is stored in fma_metadata. The data that we use to train our models is stored in fma_metadata/features.csv and fma_metadata/tracks.csv. 


      The requirements are listed at the top of each code file. 


      The code files that contain our models and the code for the graders to run are the following: 

      KRR_clean.ipynb 

      Neural_Net.ipynb 

      Perceptron.ipynb 

      SVMRBF.ipynb 


      When mounting your google drive, you are expected put your own custom file path in the os.chdir argument. To find this ctrl-F "TODO for graders"
