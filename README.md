# To get started 

The data is stored in fma_metadata. The data that we use to train our models is stored in fma_metadata/features.csv and fma_metadata/tracks.csv. 

The requirements are listed at the top of each code file. 

The code files that contain our models and the code for the graders to run are the following: 

KRR_clean.ipynb 

Neural_Net.ipynb 

Perceptron.ipynb 

SVMRBF.ipynb 

## Running Locally
This code was developed for implementation on Google Colab. As such, the filesystem invocations must be changed in accordance with your local system.
